* [RusherHack](https://rusherhack.org/) -  Priced at $20, RusherHack is primarily designed as a utility client, prioritizing a wide range of helpful utility modules.

* [Boze](https://boze.dev/) - Available for $20, Boze offers a well-rounded experience with powerful combat modules and utility. Boze also provides Ghost/blatant features tailored for non-anarchy servers, effectively bypassing anticheats.

* [Impact-Enterprise](https://impactclient.net/) - The Enterprise version of Impact lacks many modules that are considered Essential in today and isn't worth the $5 price tag, especially considering that the only difference between it and the free version is just one module. Therefore, in 2024, the client isn't worth purchasing.

* [Pyro](https://pyroclient.com/) - Pyro client, priced at $20, doesn't offer much value to the client, especially considering its discontinuation and the lack of many useful modules that are essential in today's standards.

* [Abyss](https://abyssclient.com/) The Abyss client, priced at $20, falls short in combat modules but excels in visual appeal. However, it's only for forge 1.12.2 and has been discontinued.

* [Impact-Free](https://impactclient.net/) - The Free version of Impact lacks many modules that are considered Essential in today. Therefore, in 2024, the client isn't worth using.

* [Trollhack](https://github.com/Luna5ama/TrollHack) - A remarkably potent Forge 1.12.2 client boasting impressive combat capabilities and stunning visuals. There's even speculation that this client may receive an update to Fabric 1.20."

* [Shoreline](https://github.com/pastimee/shoreline) A relatively new client for the anarchy field, it boasts about its robust combat module. However, being a recent addition, there are still some significant bugs present in the code.

* [Catalyst](https://github.com/Pr3roxDLC/Catalyst) Catalyst, once a paid client, but now its a free and open-source option for Forge 1.12.2. Even during its prime, its performance left much to be desiredâ€”it falls short in various categories and is unworthy of use in today's standards.
